== Description ==

Absolute Privacy turns your WordPress blog into a fully private site where you control who has access. It's perfect for family blogs, private communities, and personal websites.

After activating the plugin your registrations are automatically protected. First, the plugin adds new fields to the registration menu which require the registrant to enter their first and last name, and to choose a password. Newly registered members are given a WordPress role created by the plugin called "Unapproved User", and although they are registered and have a password, they are unable to login until approved.

After registering, the new user is sent an email reminding him/her that they will be unable to login until their account has been approved. The site administrator is sent an email with a link to quickly approve or delete the new user. Once the administrator approves the account the user is sent an email notification. All notification emails are fully customizable. To unapprove a user, simply edit their profile and change their "Role" to "Unapproved User".

A new tab called "Moderate Users" is created in the "Users" area which allows you to quickly view and either approve or delete all unapproved users.

By default, non-logged in visitors are redirected to the WordPress login page. You can, however, define an alternate page for them to be redirected to. You can also allow access to specific posts or pages. Also, you can prevent access to administrative pages (profile, dashboard, etc) for registered members. You also have complete control over your RSS feed (disabled, enabled, headlines only, or limited to X number of characters. 

Your blog now is absolutely private!
